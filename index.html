      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p> Hello and welcome to my page. As you can see I am called Andraya but please call me Dray for short. No need for formalisium, when the key to web development is collaberation. I have had a verity of roles over my time on this planet so far, however the running theme has been working with others to create or support their vision. This is my purpose i feel, like a great hype woman or a unfit mother trying to cheerlead! (if a horric image is imprinted on your mind, then apologies!) The point I am making is, I have the skills to support your digital hopes and dreams, so take a look at my work so far. If you like what you see then lets create something magical.</p>
